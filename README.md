# PCBR (Pairs Comparision Based Rating)

Making ratings is fun. After applying my method several times I've decided to gemify it.

### How it works

The first idea of rating items by one-to-one comparision was about QuakeLive players in 2013 or so and it didn't work well. At that time I was thinking about tree data structure. Later in May 2015 I've realised that it's simply about dots in n-dimensional space and sectors.

At the moment it's a "proof of concept". It needs huge optimisations for lookups, maybe using trees.
